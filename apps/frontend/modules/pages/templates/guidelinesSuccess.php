	<h3><span>Plugin Writing Guidelines</span></h3>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>Follow these guidelines to ensure your plugin success among the community.</p>
	</div>
	
	<ol>		
		<li class="block">Your plugin shouldn't do everything on earth. Include the most common options, and let people extend it for extra customization.</li>
		<li class="block">If there's text included from the script, make sure to include mechanisms for easy translation. One way is to integrate it with Lang.js from MooTools More.</li>
		<li class="block">Think what events and callbacks might be useful for people who want to extend the default behavior, and include them.</li>
		<li class="block">Separate into files. If you have come up with a class to do some essential functionality, and you bundle another class which extends it, make sure they're in separate files.</li>
	</ol>
