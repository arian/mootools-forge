Plugin Name
===========

What goes here is the description. Please don't make it too long. It can contain basic *styling*, **styling**, etc. 

If an image is found within the description, that becomes the screenshot of the plugin. Screenshots are optional but encouraged, given the plugin has some visual interaction.

Details
-------

We expect this section for every plugin. It shouldn't contain anything but these details:

* Stable: 0.1
* Category: UI
* Tags: animation,canvas
* Demo: http://demo_link
* Dependencies:
	* [Plugin 0.1](http://some_plugin_url "Optional dependency note")
	* [0.3](http://mootools.net/forge/p/plugin-name "Optional dependency note")

Notes: 

* The tag "Stable" detail points to an existing Git tag in your repository. 
* The category has to be one valid, existing category. See them [here](http://mootools.net/forge/categories)
* Keep tags meaningful. Tags that repeat categories names, or stuff like "Javascript", "Cool" are not valuable. Tags that depict techniques or technologies involved are encouraged, such as "canvas","accessibility". 
* We recommend using [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com) for demos. This ensures that the demo page never goes offline or becomes inaccessible. 
* If a dependency is a mootools forge link, the link text should only be the tag of the version of the foreign plugin which your plugin is known to work with. We automatically fetch the name and other details of that plugin and display them. 
* If a dependency is a regular link, the text should be the foreign plugin name and version your plugin is known to work with.

How to use
----------

We expect this section for every plugin. It just explains how to use your plugin.
Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often include code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	#JS
	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();
	
If the first line is #JS or #CSS or #HTML, then the code is highlighted accordingly. 

Screenshots
-----------

This section is optional, but encouraged if the plugin affords it. Just a list of images, one per line

Arbitrary section
-----------------

This is an arbitrary section which will become a Tab in your MooForge project page. 
Some arbitrary section examples:

* FAQ
* Notes
* Misc
* Known issues

The name is up to you, but remember to keep it meaningful and simple. Arbitrary sections are always optional.
